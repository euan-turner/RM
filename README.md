# Minsky Register Machines in Haskell

Welcome to this Minsky Register Machines tutorial. This repository is intended to serve as an educational resource for understanding Minsky register machines as a theoretical model of computation.

## Overview

Minsky register machines are simple yet powerful abstract machines introduced by Marvin Minsky in the 1960s. They are easier to grasp than Turing machines, while exhibiting the exact same computational power. 

## Tutorial Contents

1. [**Introduction**](tutorial/introduction.md): Understand the fundamentals of Minsky register machines.

2. [**Program Graphs**](tutorial/graphs.md): Visualise register machine programs to clearly illustrate their purpose.

3. [**Definitions**](tutorial/definitions.md): Delve into the essential definitions underlying the usage of register machines as a model of computation.

4. [**Encodings**](tutorial/encodings.md): Understand the bijections that allow the GÃ¶del number of a program to be calculated.

5. [**Gadgets**](tutorial/gadgets.md): Explore the power of gadgets to simplify register machine programs.

6. [**The Universal Register Machine**](tutorial/urm.md): Learn about the workings of the Universal Register Machine, and collate all course content into one register machine.

7. [**The Halting Problem**](tutorial/halting.md): Appreciate the implications of the halting problem, and how register machines prove it is undecidable.

## Following the Tutorial

To dive into the tutorial, start with the [Introduction](tutorial/introduction.md) and follow the sequential order for a comprehensive understanding. Throughout the tutorials, the accompanying Haskell code in this repository will provide practical implementations to reinforce theoretical concepts.

Happy learning!
